Folders created will be in _uppercase_ regardless of how you enter them.

# Location

Press **Browse** to locate the place where you want to create the folders.

# Create subfolders

Ticking the _Create subfolders_ allows you to specify subfolders for each of the parent folders mentioned in the **Folders** field. Default subfolders are already mentioned ,however, you may specify your own in the custom folders section by entering subfolder name in every new line.

## For example

These will be created in addition to the ones ticked.

# Changing default subfolders

If you wish to change which subfolders to display, change them in the _subfolders.txt_ file in a similar format to the **custom folders** section i.e. one line per subfolder.
