<h1>Requirements</h1>

<p>Ensure you have the following modules by running the following commands on terminal or command line:</p>

<code>pip install tkinter</code></p>

<h1>Folder text field</h1>

<p>Enter folder names using <em>comma</em> separation.</p>

<h3>For example</h3>

<p>math20,science112,english999<br />
Folders created will be in <em>uppercase</em> regardless of how you enter them.</p>

<h1>Location</h1>

<p>Press <strong>Browse</strong> to locate the place where you want to create the folders.</p>

<h1>Create subfolders</h1>

<p>Ticking the <em>Create subfolders</em> allows you to specify subfolders for each of the parent folders mentioned in the <strong>Folders</strong> field. Default subfolders are already mentioned.
    <br>However, you may specify your own in the <b>custom folders</b> section by entering subfolder name in every new line.</p>

<h2>For example</h2>

<p>Exams<br />
Past paper<br />
Notes</p>

<p>These will be created in addition to the ones ticked.</p>

<h1>Changing default subfolders</h1>

<p>If you wish to change which subfolders to display, change them in the <em>subfolders.txt</em> file in a similar format to the <strong>custom folders</strong> section i.e. one line per subfolder.</p>
